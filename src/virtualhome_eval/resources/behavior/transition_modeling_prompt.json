Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.

Here is the general format to follow:\n(:action [action name]\n  :parameters ([action parameters])\n  :precondition ([action precondition])\n  :effect ([action effect]) \n)\n\nThe :parameters is the list of variables on which the action operates. It lists variable names and variable types. \n\nThe :precondition is a first-order logic sentence specifying preconditions for an action. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: or, and, and not. The precondition should be structured in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF), meaning an OR of ANDs. The not operator should only be used within these conjunctions. For example, (or (and (predicate1 ?x) (predicate2 ?y)) (and (predicate3 ?x)))\n\nThe :effect lists the changes which the action imposes on the current state. The precondition consists of predicates and 3 possible logical operators: and, not and when. 1. The effects should generally be several effects connected by AND operators. 2. For each effect, if it is a conditional effect, use WHEN to check the conditions. The semantics of (when [condition] [effect]) are as follows: If [condition] is true before the action, then [effect] occurs afterwards. 3. If it is not a conditional effect, use predicates directly. 4. The NOT operator is used to negate a predicate, signifying that the condition will not hold after the action is executed. And example of effect is (and (when (predicate1 ?x) (not (predicate2 ?y))) (predicate3 ?x))\n\nIn any case, the occurrence of a predicate should agree with its declaration in terms of number and types of arguments defined in DOMAIN FILE at the beginning.\n\nHere is an example of the input problem file and unfinished action. after ; is a comment to explain the meaning of each line.\nInput:\nProblem file:\n(define (problem cleaning_floor_0)\n    (:domain igibson)\n\n    (:objects\n    \tfloor.n.01_1 - floor.n.01\n    \trag.n.01_1 - rag.n.01\n    \tsink.n.01_1 - sink.n.01\n    \tagent.n.01_1 - agent.n.01\n    )\n    \n    (:init \n        (dusty floor.n.01_1) \n        (stained floor.n.01_2) \n        (ontop rag.n.01_1 table.n.02_1) \n        (inroom sink.n.01_1 storage_room) \n        (onfloor agent.n.01_1 floor.n.01_2)\n    )\n    \n    (:goal \n        (and \n            (not \n                (dusty ?floor.n.01_1)\n            ) \n            (not \n                (stained ?floor.n.01_2)\n            ) \n        )\n    )\n)\nAction to be finished:\n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition ()\n  :effect ()\n)\nOutput: \n(:action clean-stained-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (soaked ?rag) ; rag is soaked\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (stained ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not stained\n)\n(:action clean-dusty-floor-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?floor - floor.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01)\n  :precondition (and (nextto ?floor ?agent) ; agent is next to floor\n                            (stained ?obj) ; floor is stained\n                            (holding ?rag)) ; agent is holding rag\n  :effect (not (dusty ?floor)) ; after the action, floor is not dusty\n)\n(:action soak-rag\n  :parameters (?rag - rag.n.01 ?agent - agent.n.01 ?sink - sink.n.01)\n  :precondition  (and (holding ?rag) ; agent is holding rag\n                            (nextto ?sink ?agent) ; agent is next to sink\n                            (toggled_on ?sink)) ; sink is toggled on\n  :effect (soaked ?rag) ; after the action, rag is soaked\n)\n\nAbove is a good example of given predicates in domain file, problem file, action names and parameters, how to write the action body in PDDL.
