# Embodied Agent Interface

Welcome! **`Embodied Agent Interface`** is a single-line evaluation pipeline to evaluate LLMs for embodied agents, which aims to tackle the following challenges in building embodied decision-making agents: 

- Standardization of goal specifications.
- Standardization of modules and interfaces.
- Broad coverage of evaluation and fine-grained metrics.


The code is [hosted on GitHub here](https://github.com/embodied-agent-eval/embodied-agent-eval).
