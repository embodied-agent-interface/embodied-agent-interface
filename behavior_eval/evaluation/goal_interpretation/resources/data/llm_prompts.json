The input will be the goal's name, the goal's description, relevant objects as well as their possible unary states, and all initial unary and binary states. The output should be the symbolic version of the goal states.\n\n\nRelevant objects in the scene indicates those objects involved in the action execution initially.

It follows the format: object name including object id, possible unary states: ...(all possible unary states). Your proposed unary object states should be within the following set: {\"Cooked\", \"Open\", \"Frozen\", \"Dusty\", \"Stained\", \"Sliced\", \"Soaked\", \"Toggled_On\"}\n\n\nRelevant objects in the scene are:\nplate.n.04_1: ['Stained', 'Dusty']\nplate.n.04_2: ['Stained', 'Dusty']\ncup.n.01_1: ['Stained', 'Dusty']\nsink.n.01_1: ['ToggledOn', 'Stained', 'Dusty']\nbowl.n.01_1: ['Stained', 'Dusty']\nfloor.n.01_1: ['Stained', 'Dusty']\ncountertop.n.01_1: ['Stained', 'Dusty']\nscrub_brush.n.01_1: ['Stained', 'Soaked', 'Dusty']\n\nAll initial states in the scene are:\n['ontop', 'plate.n.04_1', 'countertop.n.01_1']\n['ontop', 'plate.n.04_2', 'countertop.n.01_1']\n['ontop', 'bowl.n.01_1', 'countertop.n.01_1']\n['ontop', 'cup.n.01_1', 'countertop.n.01_1']\n['inside', 'scrub_brush.n.01_1', 'sink.n.01_1']\n['stained', 'plate.n.04_1']\n['stained', 'plate.n.04_2']\n['stained', 'cup.n.01_1']\n['stained', 'bowl.n.01_1']\n['onfloor', 'agent.n.01_1', 'floor.n.01_1']\n\nSymbolic goals format:\n\nNode goal states should be a set indicating the desired final goal states of single objects. Each goal in the list should be a list with two elements: the first element is the state name, which comes from the set {\"Cooked\", \"Open\", \"Frozen\", \"Dusty\", \"Stained\", \"Sliced\", \"Soaked\", \"Toggled_On\"}; the second element is the object name, which comes from the list of relevant objects in the scene provided above An example being [\"Frozen\", \"chicken.n.01_1\"]. To indicate the negation of a state such as the above example, simply use the format [\"not\", [\"Frozen\", \"chicken.n.01_1\"]].\n\n\nEdge goal states should be a set indicating the desired binary relationships between two objects. Each goal state in the set is a list of three elements: the first element is the state name, which comes from the set {\"NextTo\", \"Inside\", \"OnFloor\", \"Touching\", \"Under\"}, the second and third elements are the object names, with relationship as indicated by the first element. For example, the edge goal condition [\"inside\", \"tomato.n.01_2\", \"electric_refrigerator.n.01_1\"] indicates that the object \"tomato.n.01_2\" is inside \"electric_refrigerator.n.01_1\", and the edge goal condition [\"ontop\", \"plate.n.04_1\", \"countertop.n.01_1\"] indicates that the object \"plate.n.04_1\" is ontop of the object \"countertop.n.01_1\". Similar to node goal states, edge goal states and also be negated by simply nesting inside a \"not\", for example [\"not\", [\"inside\", \"peach.n.03_1\", \"jar.n.01_2\"]] means that the object \"peach.n.03_1\" is not inside the object \"jar.n.01_2\".\n\n\nTask Name and Goal Instructions:\n{\n    \"Task Name\": \"washing_dishes\",\n    \"Goal Instructions\": \"Wash all the stained plates, cups, and bowls.\"\n}\n\nNow using json format, output just the symbolic version of the goal states without any explanation.
