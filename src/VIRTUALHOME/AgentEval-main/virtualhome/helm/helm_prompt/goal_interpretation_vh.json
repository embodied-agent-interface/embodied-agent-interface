For example, [{'name': 'washing_machine', 'state': 'PLUGGED_IN'}, {'name': 'washing_machine', 'state': 'CLOSED'}, {'name': 'washing_machine', 'state': 'ON'}] requires the washing_machine to be PLUGGED_IN, CLOSED, and ON.

For example, [{'name': 'washing_machine', 'state': 'PLUGGED_IN'}, {'name': 'washing_machine', 'state': 'CLOSED'}, {'name': 'washing_machine', 'state': 'ON'}] requires the washing_machine to be PLUGGED_IN, CLOSED, and ON.

The value of 'from_name' and 'to_name' should be an object name. The value of 'relation' should be an relationship.
