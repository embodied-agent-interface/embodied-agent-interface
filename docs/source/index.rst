Embodied Agent Interface
========================

Welcome! **``Embodied Agent Interface``** is a single-line evaluation
pipeline to evaluate LLMs for embodied agents, which aims to tackle the
following challenges in building embodied decision-making agents:

-  Standardization of goal specifications.
-  Standardization of modules and interfaces.
-  Broad coverage of evaluation and fine-grained metrics.

The code is `hosted on GitHub
